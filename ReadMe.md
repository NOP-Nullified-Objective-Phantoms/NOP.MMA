Each `Feature` must be branched out and developed on an isolated branch and merged back into the `Developer` branch when done.
The syntax for the structure of folders must be presented as: [DeveloperName]/[Version]/[BranchName], where as branches should be named as follows: [*Root*]-[*Feature*]_[*SubFeature*].\
**Example:**
>**Folder Structure:** _Oiski/v1_ \
>**Branch Name:** _MMA-Interface_MainMenu_ \
>**Full Path:** _Oiski/v1/MMA-Interface_MainMenu_
